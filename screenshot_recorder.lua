-- screenshot recorder

--[[
    Copy and paste the text below this comment prepended with "/c" into the 
    game console to record the movie.

    `i` is the current frame
    `frames_to_record` is the amount of frames to record. The map by default can
    only hold a max of 4800 frames before you run out of memory.
    `location_of_output` is the folder name that you would like the images to 
    be saved to
    `file_format` is the format of the images to generate.
    `resolution` and `zoom` are passed into the screenshot command.

    The offset of `7` is to wait for the machine to catch up with it's timer as
    it has a 7-tick delay.
